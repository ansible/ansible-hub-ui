# Ansible Automation Hub UI

Frontend for Ansible Automation Hub. The backend for this project can be [found here](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy-dev/)

## Setting up Your Dev Environment

This app is part of the Red Hat cloud platform. Because of that the app needs to be loaded within the context of cloud.redhat.com. This is done by accessing the app via the [insights-proxy project](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-proxy).

### Set up Insights Proxy
- Install docker
- Clone this repo `git@github.com:RedHatInsights/insights-proxy.git` to your machine
- Inside the `insights-proxy/` directory on your computer, run the following scripts
  - `npm install`
  - `bash scripts/update.sh` This updates the insights proxy container to the latest version.
  - `sudo bash scripts/patch-etc-hosts.sh` This adds the following entries to your `/etc/hosts` file

```
127.0.0.1 prod.foo.redhat.com
127.0.0.1 stage.foo.redhat.com
127.0.0.1 qa.foo.redhat.com
127.0.0.1 ci.foo.redhat.com
```

Once all this is done, you can launch `insights-proxy` with this command:

```
SPANDX_CONFIG=/path/to/ansible-hub-ui/profiles/local-frontend-and-api.js bash /path/to/insights-proxy/scripts/run.sh
```

This should launch `insights-proxy`, which will redirect the routes defined in `profiles/local-frontend-and-api.js` to the automation hub UI running locally on your machine.

#### NOTE

If you are on a Mac, you might have to make a small change to the `insights-proxy/scripts/run.sh` script. Update this line

```
REALPATH=`python2 -c 'import os,sys;print os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1])' $SPANDX_CONFIG`
```

to use `python` instead of `python2`.

### Run Automation Hub

Once the insights proxy is running, open a new terminal, navigate to your local copy of `ansible-hub-ui` and execute

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`

To access the app, visit: https://ci.foo.redhat.com:1337/insights/automation-hub

### Testing

- `npm run verify` will run linters and tests
- Travis is used to test the build for this code.
  - You are always notified on failed builds
  - You are only notified on successful builds if the build before it failed
  - By default, both `push` events as well as `pull_request` events send notifications
  - Travis is defaulted to notify #insights-bots

## Deploying

- The Platform team is using Travis to deploy the application
  - The Platform team will help you set up the Travis instance if this is the route you are wanting to take

### How it works

- any push to the `{REPO}` `master` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `ci-beta` branch
- any push to the `{REPO}` `ci-stable` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `ci-stable` branch
- any push to the `{REPO}` `qa-beta` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `qa-beta` branch
- any push to the `{REPO}` `qa-stable` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `qa-stable` branch
- any push to the `{REPO}` `prod-beta` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `prod-beta` branch
- any push to the `{REPO}` `prod-stable` branch will deploy to a `{REPO}-build` `prod-stable` branch
- Pull requests (based on master) will not be pushed to `{REPO}-build` `master` branch
  - If the PR is accepted and merged, master will be rebuilt and will deploy to `{REPO}-build` `ci-beta` branch

## Patternfly

- This project imports Patternfly components:
  - [Patternfly React](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react)

## Insights Components

Insights Platform will deliver components and static assets through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@red-hat-insights/insights-frontend-components). ESI tags are used to import the [chroming](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-chrome) which takes care of the header, sidebar, and footer.

## Technologies

### Webpack

#### Webpack.config.js

This file exports an object with the configuration for webpack and webpack dev server.

```Javascript
{
    mode: https://webpack.js.org/concepts/mode/,
    devtool: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/,

    // different bundle options.
    // allows you to completely separate vendor code from app code and much more.
    // https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/
    optimization: {
        chunks: https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/#optimization-splitchunks-chunks-all,
        runtimeChunk: https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/#optimization-runtimechunk,

        // https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/#configuring-cache-groups
        cacheGroups: {

            // bundles all vendor code needed to run the entry file
            common_initial: {
                test: // file regex: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
                name: // filename: 'common.initial',
                chunks: // chunk type initial, async, all
            }
        }
    },

    // each property of entry maps to the name of an entry file
    // https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/
    entry: {

        // example bunde names
        bundle1: 'src/entry1.js',
        bundle2: 'src/entry2.js'
    },

    // bundle output options.
    output: {
            filename: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-filename,
            path: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-path,
            publicPath: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-publicpath,
            chunkFilename: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-chunkfilename
    },
     module: {
         rules: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#module-rules
     },

     // An array of webpack plugins look at webpack.plugins.js
     // https://webpack.js.org/plugins/
     plugins: [],

     // webpack dev serve options
     // https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server
     devServer: {}
}
```

### React

- High-Order Component

  - a [higher-order component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component
    - Ex) [asyncComponent.js](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-frontend-starter-app/src/Utils/asyncComponent.js)

- [Smart/Presentational Components](https://medium.com/@thejasonfile/dumb-components-and-smart-components-e7b33a698d43)
  - Smart components have access to the redux state
  - Presentational components do not have access to the redux state
  - Smart Components === insights-frontend/app/js/states
  - Presentational Components === insights-frontend/app/js/components

- [State and lifecycle within class components](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
  - article contains:
    - Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class
    - Adding Local State to a Class
    - State Updates May Be Asynchronous
    - State Updates are Merged

### Redux

#### Store

A [store](https://redux.js.org/basics/store) holds the whole [state tree](https://redux.js.org/glossary) of your application.
Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function.

[Create Store](https://redux.js.org/api-reference/createstore): ```createStore(reducer, preloadedState, enhancer)```

- methods
  - [getState()](https://redux.js.org/api-reference/store#dispatch)
  - [dispatch(action)](https://redux.js.org/api-reference/store#dispatch)
  - [subscribe(listener)](https://redux.js.org/api-reference/store#subscribe)
  - [replaceReducer(nextReducer)](https://redux.js.org/api-reference/store#replaceReducer)

#### Actions

[Actions](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions) are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. You send them to the store using [store.dispatch()](https://redux.js.org/api-reference/store#dispatch).
Redux actions should only have two properties, type and payload, as a best practice.

- Async Actions frameworks

  - [redux-promise-middleware](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware)
    - Currently using this
      - look at [/src/api/System/getSystems.js](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/turbo-octo-couscous/tree/master/src/api/System/getSystems.js)
  - [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
    - A function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation
    ```Javascript
    // gotSystems(Error) are action creators
    function getSystems() {
          return function (dispatch) {
            return fetchSystems().then(
              systems => dispatch(gotSystems(systems)),
              error => dispatch(gotSystemsError(error))
            );
          };
        }
    ```
  - [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga/)
    - Uses [generator functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*)
    - Could be a lot to learn initially.
  - [redux-pack](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/redux-pack)

#### Reducers

[Reducers](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers) specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

Ex) [/src/api/System/getSystems.js](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/turbo-octo-couscous/tree/master/src/api/System/getSystems.js)

### React-redux

- [Provider](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api/Provider.md)
  - Makes the Redux store available to the connect()
- [connect([mapStateToProps], [mapDispatchToProps], [mergeProps], [options])](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options)
  - Connects a React component to a Redux store

### React-router-dom

When setting up the routes, the page content is wrapped with a `.page__{pageName}` class, applied to the `#root` ID that is determined by the `rootClass` in the `Routes.js` which lets you easily reference the page in the styling.

- [BrowserRouter](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter)
  - A `<Router>` that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL
- [Route](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route)
- [Switch](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Switch)
  - Renders the first child `<Route>` or `<Redirect>` that matches the location.
- [Redirect](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Redirect)
  - navigate to a new location
- [withRouter](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/withRouter)
  - passes updated match, location, and history props to the wrapped component whenever it renders

## Running locally
Have [insights-proxy](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-proxy) installed under PROXY_PATH

```shell
SPANDX_CONFIG="./config/spandx.config.js" bash $PROXY_PATH/scripts/run.sh
```

### Testing - jest

When you want to test your code with unit tests please use `jest` which is preconfigured in a way to colect codecoverage as well. If you want to see your coverage on server the travis config has been set in a way that it will send data to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) the only thing you have to do is visit their website (register), enable your repository and add CODECOV_TOKEN to your travis web config (do not add it to .travis file, but trough [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/))
